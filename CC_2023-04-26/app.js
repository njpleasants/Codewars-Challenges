//Sentence Smash 8kyu
//Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!
//P: The array will not be empty, there should be no spaces at the beggining or end of the sentence
//R: Return the array of words combined into a sentence
//E: ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'
//P: 
function smash (word1, word2, word3) {
    return arr.join(' ');
 };

 //Other Codewars solutions
 const smash = words => words.join(' ');
